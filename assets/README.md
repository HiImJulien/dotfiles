### Retro Space

![Retro Space by AIR_TI; altered to ImageGoNord using Catppuccin](./retrospace-catppuccin.png)

I initially found this image
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImageGoNord/comments/1cn4t68/catppuccin_you_asked_for_high_resolution_retro/),
which was altered using ImageGoNord to match the Catppuccin Mocha Theme.
The "original" can be found
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/comments/1cmync4/you_asked_for_high_resolution_retro_space_8k/).
Note, that this version is apparently also only a derivate, the author AIR_TI
didn't include any links to the original.
